# Adiecon 2020 Talk - Intro to Search Engines with Elasticsearch


Collection of queries and mappings used for my AdieCon talk

Follow steps in the Elasticsearch documentation to set up your own local Elasticsearch:
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/getting-started-install.html

After installing your local Elasticsearch, run Elasticsearch and while it is running, copy the curl command [here](https://github.com/hisaacdelr/AdieconTalk01312020/blob/master/documents/curl_post_docs.txt) against your locally running Elasticsearch cluster to ingest sample documents into it.
